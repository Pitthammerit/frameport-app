# Project History - Frameport App

## Project Inception
**Date**: [Current Date]
**Initial Vision**: Create Frameport App - a modern, performant photo collaboration platform that streamlines the photographer-client feedback process.

## Key Decisions Log

### Technology Stack Selection
**Date**: [Current Date]
**Decision**: Next.js + Supabase + Cloudflare R2
**Rationale**: 
- Next.js for modern React development with App Router
- Supabase for auth, database, and real-time features
- Cloudflare R2 for cost-effective, performant image storage
- Combination provides excellent DX and performance

### Architecture Decisions

#### Direct Upload to R2
**Decision**: Implement direct browser-to-R2 uploads using presigned URLs
**Rationale**: 
- Reduces server load
- Faster upload experience
- Better scalability
- Cost optimization

#### Real-time Collaboration
**Decision**: Use Supabase Realtime for live updates
**Rationale**:
- Built-in WebSocket management
- Automatic reconnection handling
- Postgres-backed persistence
- Simplified implementation

## Development Timeline

- Established folder structure following Next.js best practices
- Set up project documentation (claude.md, todo.md, project_history.md)
- Defined MVP scope and feature roadmap

### Upcoming Milestones

#### MVP Launch (Target: 3-4 weeks)
- Basic photographer authentication
- Drag-and-drop uploads (JPEG/PNG)
- Gallery creation and sharing
- Password-protected links
- Email notifications

#### Phase 2 (Target: +4-5 weeks)
- Color marking system
- Star ratings
- Collaboration/Presentation modes
- RAW/PSD support
- Multi-photographer support

#### Phase 3 (Target: +3-4 weeks)
- Real-time collaboration
- PWA implementation
- Video support (MOV)
- Enhanced mobile experience

## Technical Decisions

### Frontend Architecture
- **Component Structure**: Feature-based organization
- **State Management**: React Context + Hooks
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (core utilities only)
- **Type Safety**: TypeScript throughout

### Backend Architecture
- **API Routes**: RESTful design with Next.js App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Supabase
- **File Storage**: Cloudflare R2 with CDN
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth with JWT

### Performance Targets
- Gallery load time: <2 seconds
- Upload initiation: <500ms
- Real-time latency: <100ms
- Lighthouse score: >90

## Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: File Upload UX
**Problem**: Need smooth upload experience for large files
**Solution**: 
- Chunked uploads with progress tracking
- Background uploads with service worker
- Optimistic UI updates

### Challenge: Real-time Sync
**Problem**: Handling concurrent edits and conflicts
**Solution**:
- Operational transformation for markings
- Last-write-wins for ratings
- Conflict resolution UI when needed

## Pivot Points

### Initial Scope Adjustment
**Original**: Full-featured platform from start
**Adjusted**: Phased approach with MVP focus
**Reason**: Faster time-to-market and user feedback integration
